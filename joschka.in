.SH DESCRIPTION
.B joschka
is a computer science student from somewhere outside of Bavaria where there
are apparently no standards on education. Or at least noone can imagine
how he managed to get his a-levels.

His favourite activities include chatting during days and night, reading
4players, Golem and Heise. He also spends money on games from Steam, so
that other friends who visit him have something to do.

Don't let him change the font settings of your computer. He apparently likes
ugly fontrendering that is even more unreadable than the one that Apple uses.

the revision matters.

place.
